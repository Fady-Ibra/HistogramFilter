# HistogramFilter
In this Python Project, we complete a 2D Histogram Filter that is used as a localization technique for self-driving cars (also known as Monte Carlo localization). 

The code contains a simulation and a map (a 2D grid) that the car can sense and move on.
Initially, the car starts out with no idea where it is, which is represented by uniform blue dots on the grid, then the sense and move functions reduce uncertainty and help localize a car based on knowledge about a car's surroundings!
